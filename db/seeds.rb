    bio: "I have deep devotion and fondness toward what I do and I've been been fortunate enough to be actively practicing massage therapy since 2001, esthetics since 2003, and lifestyle counseling, nutritional education and holistic meal preparation since 2011. My goal is to fully treat the whole you, not only the physical you. At this point I focus my energy specializing in the four modalities I grow to love more and more daily; massage therapy, waxing, skin care and nutrition education.\r\n\r\nIf I had to describe the style of bodywork I perform, I would use the word fundamental. I make use of an integrative technique in a minimalist way to help relieve the burden of stress accumulating in the body, the pressure and discomfort of having an injury. I concentrate in NMT, deep tissue and myofascial release techniques. Through these modalities and my particular isolated technique, the motivation is to release tender and painful tension without more discomfort, through patience and attentiveness, compassion and understanding. Developing a supportive, warm, relaxing and safe setting to let go...\r\n\r\nIn esthetics, my priority is results. Skin care for face and body should be simple and have outstanding efficacy. Clean products, specialized services and professional education for women, men, teens and even children in the proper approach to healthy skin.\r\n\r\nWith waxing, you can always expect total professionalism, complete discretion, and unyielding, definitive cleanliness for all waxing services including my self-taught Brazilian waxing techniques.\r\n\r\nToday and what lies ahead... I now produce organic, all natural, naturally derived, self-sustaining, and local-ingredient-infused handmade facial and body care products, including the body treatments and massage blends we use at A Touch of Tranquility. I feel it is of the utmost importance to offer our guests not only a superior quality product or treatment, but one that is also distinctive, effective, clean and designed specifically for you.\r\n\r\nWith sincerity, I express many thanks to all who have supported us throughout the years and those whom lie ahead.\r\n",
