      NYS Licensed Massage Therapist and Esthetician
      Certified Infant Massage Therapist and Instructor
      Certified Holistic Health and Nutrition Consultant
      Nutritional education and holistic meal preparation
    bio: "I have deep devotion and fondness toward what I do and I've been been fortunate
      enough to be actively practicing massage therapy since 2001, esthetics since
      2003, and lifestyle counseling, nutritional education and holistic meal preparation
      since 2011. My goal is to fully treat the whole you, not only the physical you.
      At this point I focus my energy specializing in the four modalities I grow to
      love more and more daily; massage therapy, waxing, skin care and nutrition education.\r\n\r\nIf
      I had to describe the style of bodywork I perform, I would use the word fundamental.
      I make use of an integrative technique in a minimalist way to help relieve the
      burden of stress accumulating in the body, the pressure and discomfort of having
      an injury. I concentrate in NMT, deep tissue and myofascial release techniques.
      Through these modalities and my particular isolated technique, the motivation
      is to release tender and painful tension without more discomfort, through patience
      and attentiveness, compassion and understanding. Developing a supportive, warm,
      relaxing and safe setting to let go...\r\n\r\nIn esthetics, my priority is results.
      Skin care for face and body should be simple and have outstanding efficacy.
      Clean products, specialized services and professional education for women, men,
      teens and even children in the proper approach to healthy skin.\r\n\r\nWith
      waxing, you can always expect total professionalism, complete discretion, and
      unyielding, definitive cleanliness for all waxing services including my self-taught
      Brazilian waxing techniques.\r\n\r\nToday and what lies ahead... I now produce
      organic, all natural, naturally derived, self-sustaining, and local-ingredient-infused
      handmade facial and body care products, including the body treatments and massage
      blends we use at A Touch of Tranquility. I feel it is of the utmost importance
      to offer our guests not only a superior quality product or treatment, but one
      that is also distinctive, effective, clean and designed specifically for you.\r\n\r\nWith
      sincerity, I express many thanks to all who have supported us throughout the
      years and those whom lie ahead.\r\n"
